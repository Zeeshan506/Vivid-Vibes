Description: 
Vivid Vibes is a Social Media Platform with A very Sleek Front End and an organized and sophisticated Back End.
The main idea is a Project designed to demonstrate the connection between the Front End of a web application and The Database Behind it.

Tools Used:
- Xampp Control Panel.
- Visual Studio Code

Languages:
- The code doesn't feature any framework.
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- SQL

Overview:
Vivid Vibes features a social media platform that has a beautiful Front End and an accurate back End.
The connectivity was established using PHP. 
Everything is being fetched in real time other than the images. 
For Images, I managed to code a custom algo, which enables different images to load for different users. 
not a complex logic but managed to accomplish.
No doubt if real-time images are fetched we can call it done for now for this specific Project. 

Expected Improvements:

- Including a Searching Service to Search for other cretors or Users.
- Adding an active messaging service for User.
- Adding an add comment option.
- adding an like option.
- adding proper following lists for each users to manage thier following list. 
- Password Recovery
- Hashed Passwords for users security
- Realtime Image Fetching
- using advanced frameworks such as Laravel
- perhaps changing from PHP to Python since it seems outdated.

Credits:
The Front End was taken From a youtube Creator EGATOR. His design includes a Single Page with no back End. 
The Project was further Enhanced into this. here is a link to the actual video.
